1.38.0;

(!) Weekend 1 has been added! (WIP + there's some issues)
Added the Vanilla-styled scoreTxt from 0.5.0 and up. It might be slightly inaccurate but it's as close as possible to the original.
funnyTips now has 2 new default tips
The functionality of the "JS Engine Recharts" option was refactored
All future updates will now have a 5-second wait when running update.bat. This should fix the problem with updates not installing going forward!
The engine can now originally tell if you played a song in Freeplay and had the "Always Play Cutscenes" option enabled!
The Rating Popup spawning was reworked a bit, and now no longer causes lag when too many popups are spawned at once.
The speed of the popups disappearing is no longer reliant on BPM.
(WIP) The engine will now automatically auto-save charts.
Turning on "Instakill on Miss" will stop the game from showing you your miss count.
renderlol.bat will now ask you for the video framerate.
Sustain Splashes will no longer last longer than they should after a BPM change
The infamous "0-2147483648:0-2147483648:0-2147483648 remaining" glitch when an update finishes downloading has finally been patched... hopefully
Fixed Sustain Notes not having their color updated if the Change Character event was called while using Char-Based note colors
Fixed a random Week 4 crash
