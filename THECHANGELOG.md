1.37.0;

Added the Hold Note Splashes from Base 0.3.X and up (special thanks to Psych Online (more specifically, NotMagniill and Snirozu) for the code. Also no, you currently cannot turn them off separately)
Removed 1 line from botplayText. turns out that link Nael put there was a link that got hacked and now redirects to a website containing nono things!!
Fixed custom notes having a strange offset (Spoiler alert: it still occurs for sustain notes.. but its progress, right?)
Fixed a crash that would randomly occur if you pressed CTRL+Z in the Chart Editor
Fixed Rating sprites being haxeflixel logos in some parts of the engine!
